No Special Instruction. Just the project. The equals works, but I didn't know how to incorporate it into the post fix. To test it, you can use the calculator method on a
already post fix equation. I also didn't know how to stack variables (a=b=) or to implement the multiple plus/minus signs. My error messages also arent detailed, because I
forgot about them until it was too late to go back and change them (sorry). Most other things should work. My iterator prints each iteration each time the while loop in 
the calculation method goes, so it rearranges it to post fix right before giving you the answer.
