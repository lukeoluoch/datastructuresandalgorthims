There were features I was able to put in additionally, and bugs I was unable to outsmart.

Features:
Keyboard controls
When the row is all broken, the bomb resets to a new location
5 second timer

Bugs:
The Score was a problem because couldn't figure out how to make it work outside of the for loop it is in.
The arc on player 2's projectile is upside down
Both arcs are not a very accurate, but they do get a little close.
if no velocity and angle is entered, it goes straight for the bottom row (I kept that in so I could test the row erasing).
when the velocity is high, the arc sis draw with dots very far between

That's it! pls have mercy on my soul ;_;
